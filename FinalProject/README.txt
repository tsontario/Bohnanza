Tim Smith (6693759): Worked on Card Hierarchy, Chain, Deck, CardFactory, pausing to and loading from file
(including istream constructors), first half of main game loop, general bug fixes.

Mark Mroz (6846979): Worked on Hand, Table, Player, TradeArea, DiscardPile, second half of main game loop, general bug fixes.

The work was not mutually exclusive. There was a large crossover as changes made by one member had repercussions
for choices made by the other.

FRAUD ALERT: We hosted our project on GitHub. Originally it was here: https://github.com/mmroz/CSI2372Project/graphs/traffic.
Professor Lang has already been made aware of this. In light of this, we moved our repository to a differently named one
at https://github.com/tsontario/DamnBohnan/. Curiously, even though we had ceased working on the first repository, we
noticed a surge in traffic on December 6 and 7 totalling over 300 views and 17 unique visitors. At this point (December 8)
it doesn't seem like our new repository has been compromised.
